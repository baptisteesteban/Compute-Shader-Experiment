# Compute Shader Experiment

This is just a small experiment I made to include the compute shader in one of my college project.

I found difficult to find clear resources on the net about the compute shader so I just let it here.

It is just a particle moving in the clipping space. But it is enough (to me) to understand how to
change the values inside a VBO (Vertex Buffer Object) using SSBO.

## Dependencies

* SDL2
* GLEW
